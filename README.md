# Ecommerce App README

Welcome to the Ecommerce App repository! This project consists of two main folders: "frontend" and "backend," designed to create a comprehensive Ecommerce application. This README will guide you through the process of setting up and using the application.

## Getting Started

To start using the Ecommerce App, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ABHISHEKnayak0110/Ecommerce
```
### 2. Start the Backend Server
Before launching the frontend, ensure that the backend server is running to provide API services. Here's how to start the backend server:

Step 1: Navigate to the backend folder using the terminal:
cd backend

Step 2: Install the necessary Node.js modules:
npm install

Step 3: Start the server:
npm start

The backend server will start on port 3050.

### 3. Start the Frontend
Now that the backend server is running, you can start the frontend of the Ecommerce App. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Navigate to the frontend folder using the terminal:
cd frontend

Step 2: Install the required Npm modules:
npm install

Step 3: Launch the frontend:
npm start

The frontend will be accessible at ```http://localhost:3000/.```

###Using the Application
Once both the frontend and backend servers are up and running, you can start using the Ecommerce App. Here's a brief overview of how to use the application:

####Adding Items to Cart:

- Browse the product listings.
- Select the quantity of items you want to purchase.
- Click the "Add to Cart" button for each item.

####Viewing Cart:

- The Cart icon on the top right corner will display the number of items in your cart.
- Click on the Cart icon to view the items added to your cart.

####Checking Out:

- In the Cart view, click the "Checkout" button.
- The application will calculate the total price of your order.
- If you qualify for a discount (e.g., every 4th order), it will be applied, and the discount code will be displayed.

That's it! You can now use the Ecommerce App to shop for items and manage your cart.
